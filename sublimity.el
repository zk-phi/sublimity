;; Author: zk_phi
;; URL: https://github.com/zk-phi/sublimity
;; Version: 1.1.4
;; Package-Requires: ((cl-lib "0.3"))

;;; Commentary:

;; Require this script and some of "sublimity-scroll" "sublimity-map".
;;
;;   (require 'sublimity)
;;   (require 'sublimity-scroll)

;;   (require 'sublimity-map)
;;
;; then call command "M-x sublimity-mode".

;; If you want to enable sublimity everywhere, call function
;; sublimity-global-mode.
;;
;;   (sublimity-global-mode)

;; For more informations, see "Readme".

;;; Change Log:

;; 1.0.0 first released
;; 1.1.0 turn into minor-mode
;; 1.1.1 add sublimity-mode-hook
;; 1.1.2 add sublimity-handle-scroll-criteria
;;       remove add-hook in toplevel
;;       make sublimity-mode global
;; 1.1.3 scroll-bar workaround
;; 1.1.4 divide `sublimity-handle-scroll-criteria' into three separate options
